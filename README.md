If you don't have account, create one.

To rerun the server and design, make sure that the previous processes are completely terminated.
You can run only one server at a time but multiple Design class as the same time as the program supports multiple user at a time.
To see the database, find within the project the file names "database.json" this is where the database is stored.




*************************TEST*********************************
To run the JUNIT test, run class "ServerMethodsTest.java" and view coverage. All testable classes are:

-"ServerMethodsTest.java"
-"userTest.java"
-"ClientMethodsTest.java"

Coverage of these tests of the classes should be above 80% (Branch coverage)
Classes such as "Design"and "ClientListener.java" are not required to be tested.
WARNING: BEFORE YOU RUN ANY TEST, MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE RUNNING PROGRAM LIKE SERVERS ARE ELIMINATED. 
FAIL OF DOING SO WILL RESULT IN TEST NOT WORKING.
